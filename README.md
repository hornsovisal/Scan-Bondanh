# Scan-Bondanh: Network Scanning & Security Assessment Tool

**Scan-Bondanh** is a lightweight, educational, and multi-threaded network scanning tool written in Python. It is designed to perform essential network reconnaissance, including host discovery, detailed port scanning, and service detection, providing clear reports for system administrators and cybersecurity students.

---

##  Key Features

* **Host Discovery:** Uses multiple methods to reliably detect active hosts: ICMP ping, ARP scanning (local subnet).
* **High-Speed Scanning:** Implements **multi-threading** for efficient and rapid port scanning across large ranges.
* **Service Detection:** Attempts **banner grabbing** to identify running services (e.g., SSH, HTTP) on open ports.
* **Customizable:** Scan behavior is controlled via external configuration files (`.json`, `.yaml`).
* **Reporting:** Generates structured, machine-readable **JSON** and human-readable **TXT** reports.
* **Modular Architecture:** Built using an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) approach for easy testing and future expansion.

##  Project Setup

### Prerequisites

You must have Python 3.x installed. You may also need to run the tool with elevated privileges (`sudo` or Administrator) for low-level socket operations (like ARP or raw ICMP).

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   **Bash**

   ```
   git clone [YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL]
   cd Py-Scan-Network-Tool
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies:**
   All necessary external libraries are listed in `requirements.txt`.
   **Bash**

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
